# Algorithms and Datastructures

## About

This is a collection of implementations of some algorithms and datastructures that were used in the same-titled university course I took in the second semester.

The implementations are based on those in the textbook **Algorithms, 4th Edition** by _Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne_. Even though I mainly focused on the textbook, I highly recommend their great online learning resources and implementations [on this website](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
